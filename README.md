## The Problem

Training large machine learning models often feels like a black box. One minute everything's running ‚Äî the next, you're staring at a cryptic `"CUDA out of memory"` error.  

Pinpointing *which* part of the model is consuming too much memory or slowing things down is frustrating and time-consuming. Traditional profiling tools can be overly complex or lack the granularity deep learning developers need.

---

## Why TraceML?

`traceml` is a lightweight CLI tool to instrument your PyTorch training scripts and get real-time, granular insights into:

- System and process-level CPU , GPU & RAM usage  
- PyTorch layer-level memory allocation (via `gc` or decorator/instance tracing)

All shown live in your terminal ‚Äî no config, no setup, just plug-and-trace.

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

```bash
traceml run <your_training_script.py>
```

TraceML wraps your training script and prints memory insights to the terminal as your model trains.


### Examples

```bash
# Default: garbage collection-based tracing (no changes to code needed)
traceml run src/examples/tracing_with_gc

# Trace an explicitly defined model instance (e.g., functional API or Sequential model)
traceml run src/examples/tracing_with_model_instance

# Trace a model using a class decorator (recommended for structured training code)
traceml run src/examples/tracing_with_class_decorator
```

## Current Features

- **Live CPU, RAM and GPU usage** (System + Current Process)  
-  **PyTorch layer-level memory tracking**:
  -  Default: via `gc` scanning (zero setup but no activation/gradient tracking)
  -  Via `@trace_model` class decorator
  -  Via `trace_model_instance()` function for manual model instance tracing
-  **Model memory summaries** (per-layer + total)
-  **Activation memory tracking**

---

## Coming Soon

- **Gradient memory tracking**
- **Export logs as JSON / CSV**
